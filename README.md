# DDoS UDP Scripts (2021)

# Description 
Hello guys, I'm releasing a python that I used to start DDoS attacks test on servers, so here you go. It contains : a compilated udp script created in C language (not by me, I changed the code and added threads) and a python script created by me.

# How to use
chmod * udp
python3 udphex.py
