# Description 
Hello guys, I'm releasing a python script that I used to start DDoS attacks test on servers, so here you go. It contains : a compilated udp script created in C language (not by me, I changed the code : I added threads and compilaed it but can't find the src code lolol) and a python script created by me.


# I'M NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANYTHING YOU DO WITH THESES SCRIPTS, USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK


# How to use
- chmod +x udp 
- ./udp IP PORT TIME THREADS
- python3 udphex.py IP PORT THREADS TIME
