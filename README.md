# DDoS UDP Scripts (2021)

# Description 
Hello guys, I'm releasing a python that I used to start DDoS attacks test on servers, so here you go. It contains : a compilated udp script created in C language (not by me, I changed the code and added threads) and a python script created by me.


I'M NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANYTHING YOU DO WITH THESES SCRIPTS



# How to use
- chmod +x udp 
- python3 udphex.py <IP> <PORT> <THREADS> <TIME>
